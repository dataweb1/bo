# BO

## Introduction

The module delivers a out-of-the-box solution for inline content management with a lot of much used elements predefined, to have a quick start.

BO makes use of the Drupal core functionality like blocks, views and media(library) so the dependencies of other modules is minimal.

## Installation

```
composer require datawab1/bo
```

## Quick start

After installing the module add the 'BO overview' block to a specific region on your theme via the 'Block layout'. You can restrict the appearance of the block to your needs but it is not required as the block will not render without elements.
